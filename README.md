# Web_Crawler
When passed a url, the crawler breaks down the site content and stores every word in a relational database so that it can be searched for later, similar to
the way google indexes a website to display it in search results. Uses html, css, javascript, jquery, php, bootstrap and mysql. htmlParse.php includes the php code that breaks down the webpages you feed it and stores it in the database.
